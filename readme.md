# React vote workshop

Given an API and this boilerplate, you have to create a simple interface permitting the user to vote for a subject of your choice.
The only thing we ask you is to have fun and try to stick to functional programming as much as you can.

We impose you to work with the following tech:
- React
- Redux
- Webpack
- Babel

But then you can chose wathever you want for the rest of the stack, although we sugget the following:
- Redux-thunk (Manage side effects)
- Styled-component for styling

Bonus point for using the following ones:
- Typescript
- Redux-observable

Big bonus point for using:
- Elm
- Purescript
